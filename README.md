# Linear models

Data parsing, scattering and training with basic ML linear algorithms. Adaptations and extensions to 
Aurélien Geron exercises from [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensor Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291) 

## Getting Started

Project available thru Jupyter notebook or by simply running the python script

### Data sets

* Better Life Index data at [oecd.org](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=BLI)
* International Monetary Fund data [imf.org](http://goo.gl/j1MSKe) 

### Built With

* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - The ML library
* [matpotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) - The plotting library
* [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) - The package for scientific computing
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - The open-source web application for the notebook

### Installing

Install third-party libraries

```
python -m pip install -U  scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas scikit-learn
```

### Running

Simply run the script by executing:

```
./main.py
```
